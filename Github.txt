Github is website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git.

https://github.com 

we can generally use two methods to store and track data.

(1) create directory on github then clone it on local.
(2) create files on local first and then set remote.
     then push the code on remote directory.


there are 4 status of code/files

(1) untracked --> new file that Git is not tracking
(2) modified --> changes have been made
(3) staged --> change/file is ready to be commited
(4) unmodified --> unchanged, no change to be committed



FORK:
========
A fork is a new repo that shares code and visibility setting with the original "upstream"
repo.
let's say FORK is a rough copy.
